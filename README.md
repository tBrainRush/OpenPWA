# OpenPWA

OpenPWA is a project designed to create small web apps for iOS and Android by leveraging iOS configuration profiles and a dedicated Android app. This project is currently in development, allowing the creation of both stateless and stateful web apps, depending on hosting availability.

## Features

- **Web App Creation**: Easily create web apps that can be installed on iOS and Android devices.
- **iOS Configuration Profiles**: Install web apps directly on iOS devices using configuration profiles.
- **Android App Integration**: Install web apps on Android via a dedicated app that adds home screen shortcuts with custom names and icons.
- **Full-Screen Experience**: On Android, web apps run in a WebView for an immersive, native-like experience.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed for iOS and Android, but accessible from any device with a web browser.
- **Local Installation Link**: Share a link to install a PWA even if it is not hosted anywhere, by executing the code locally.

## How to Use

### On iOS
1. **Create Your Web App**:
   - Use the OpenPWA editor to write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
   - Customize the app title, description, and icon.

2. **Install the Web App**:
   - Generate the configuration profile and install it on your iOS device.
   - The web app will be added to your home screen and can be launched like any other app.

### On Android
1. **Install the OpenPWA Android App**:
   - To use OpenPWA on Android, you need to install the dedicated Android app.

2. **Create and Install the Web App**:
   - Use the OpenPWA editor to create your web app.
   - Open the OpenPWA Android app, add the web app as a home screen shortcut with a custom name and icon.
   - The web app will open in full-screen WebView mode for a native-like experience.

### Hosting (Optional)
- If you need a stateful web app, you can host it on GitHub Pages, Altervista, or any other hosting service.
- Stateless web apps can be created and installed without hosting, but they will not retain state between sessions.
- You can also share a link to install a PWA even if it is not hosted, allowing execution directly from local storage.
